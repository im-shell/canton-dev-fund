# Axcess: Institutional Undercollateralized Credit Markets on Canton

# Abstract

Axcess is a modular private credit platform for undercollateralized lending in digital assets, starting with curated loan vaults for institutional trading firms. On Canton, Axcess becomes an institutional‑grade credit primitive: lenders allocate into permissioned vaults, borrowers access capital under continuous on‑ledger supervision, and custody and risk partners like Ceffu and Chainrisk drive fund movements and interventions from verifiable ledger events. Over roughly 14 weeks, we will ship an open‑source Canton implementation of Axcess-AML contracts, backend services, custody bridge, automation, and documentation deployed to Canton testnet and ready for ecosystem integrations. We are requesting a grant of $50,000 USD (currently about 318,000 CC) to fund this work.

# Motivation

Crypto credit today is dominated by overcollateralized lending, where borrowers routinely post 120–150% collateral for access to working capital, which is inherently capital‑inefficient and excludes many otherwise strong institutional borrowers. At the other extreme, existing undercollateralized protocols have often relied on snapshot financial audits, opaque borrower disclosures, and passive smart contracts, leading to information asymmetry, hidden leverage, and slow or ineffective responses in stress events, as seen in prior protocol failures.

Axcess is designed to bridge this gap: it creates curated loan vaults for institutional trading firms, combining rigorous, ongoing due diligence with an infrastructure layer that includes custodian‑based fund control (via partners like Ceffu), real‑time monitoring, and active circuit breakers for risk management. By integrating partners such as Ampersan as launch borrowers and Chainrisk as a risk engine provider, Axcess turns undercollateralized credit from a pure “trust game” into a structured, continuously supervised product that can still deliver competitive yields to lenders.

# Canton Ecosystem Synergies

Axcess brings private credit to the Canton ecosystem. Our loan vault approach seamlessly integrates with existing network applications like Temple and Acme, and provides infrastructure for RWA tokens—either as collateral or through cross-application looping strategies.

As [mentioned by Temple](https://x.com/temple_ny/status/2020136161440657880), their move into institutional vaults reflects strong demand for competitive yields given the influx of institutional capital on Canton. We envision integrating Axcess vaults within the Temple trading ecosystem, and vice versa.

While Axcess is still early-stage, we're exploring a yield-bearing token built on top of our credit vaults. As vaults mature and yields stabilize, we plan to launch a DeFi-composable token that expresses vault yields. With target returns of 10–14%, such a token could become a valuable component of DeFi strategies and a significant benefit for lenders and LPs on Canton.

# Specification

## 1. Objective
Axcess creates loan vaults comprising curated portfolios of institutional borrowers, encoding origination, drawdown, monitoring, and repayment into smart contracts and infrastructure.

On Canton, Axcess will deliver:

- DAML templates for lender pools and borrower facilities, with on‑ledger representations of core legal terms and covenants.
- Borrower onboarding and monitoring interfaces, with hooks to risk engines such as the Axcess–Chainrisk framework.
- Lender/operator APIs and a light reference UI for pool creation, borrower onboarding, allocation, and risk monitoring.
- Interoperability and settlement patterns with tokenized cash and custodial venues, including flows modeled on Ceffu’s MirrorX/RSV architecture.

## 2. Technical Implementation

### **DAML Smart Contract Layer [Open-Source]**

| **DAML Template** | **Replaces (EVM)** | **Responsibilities** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `VaultFactory` | `VaultFactory.sol` | Vault creation with borrower verification, asset whitelisting, parameter validation |
| `LoanVault` | `LoanVault.sol` | Core vault lifecycle: deposits, withdrawal requests, epoch transitions, fund transfers, collateral management |
| `DepositReceipt` | ERC20 share tokens | Per-lender deposit tracking with activation epoch, share calculation |
| `WithdrawalRequest` | On-chain withdrawal queue | Queued withdrawals with epoch-aware processing windows |
| `EpochRecord` | Epoch events | Immutable record of each processed epoch (amounts, rates, timestamps) |
| `AssetRegistry` | ERC20 token list | Whitelisted Canton-native assets with metadata and pricing |
| `BorrowerProfile` | Off-chain borrower table | On-ledger borrower identity and verification status |

Key DAML design decisions:

- Choices over transactions: Deposit, withdraw, process-epoch, and move-funds are modeled as DAML choices on the `LoanVault` template, with explicit signatories and observers ensuring only authorized parties can trigger state transitions.
- Epoch validation on-ledger: The 7-day epoch cycle, deposit activation windows (1-day notice), and withdrawal processing windows (3-day notice) are enforced in DAML contract logic rather than an off-chain bot, removing trust assumptions.
- Composable asset model: Instead of wrapping ERC20s, vaults natively hold DAML-based token contracts issued by participants, enabling atomic settlement with other Canton DeFi protocols.
- Open-source contract layer: The full DAML package - all templates, choices, and test scripts will be published as an open-source reference implementation. Canton developers building lending, credit, or epoch-based settlement applications can use it as a foundation, accelerating DeFi development on the network.

### **Backend Services Layer**

| **Service** | **Technology** | **Role** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| API Server | Hono (TypeScript) | User auth (JWT + Canton party identity), vault browsing, portfolio queries, borrower onboarding |
| Ledger Connector | Canton Ledger API / gRPC | Subscribe to contract events, execute DAML choices, replace Ponder indexer |
| Participant Query Store (PQS) | Canton PQS | Queryable read model of ledger state, replaces PostgreSQL `ponder` schema for indexed data |
| Epoch Automation | TypeScript Ledger API Bot (Existing) | Automated epoch processing, deposit activation, withdrawal settlement |
| Custody Bridge | Node.js service | Ceffu MirrorX integration - orchestrates off-ledger custody flows |

The existing Hono API is largely preserved, but data sources shift from Ponder (EVM indexer) to PQS (Canton query store). The epoch bot transforms from an off-chain cron worker into a Canton automation trigger that exercises DAML choices at epoch boundaries.

### **Custody Integration (Ceffu MirrorRSV)**

The Ceffu custody integration remains off-chain but is re-triggered by Canton ledger events instead of EVM events:

1. `LoanVault` choice `TransferToCustodian` creates a `CustodyTransferRequest` contract
2. Custody bridge service observes the contract, initiates Ceffu deposit → delegation flow
3. On return, the bridge exercises a `ConfirmFundsReturned` choice with settlement proof
4. Epoch processing proceeds with returned funds available

This preserves the existing Ceffu API integration (RSA-signed requests, MirrorRSV delegate/undelegate, settlement) while anchoring the trust model on-ledger.

## 3. **Architectural Alignment**

- **Canton's privacy model** directly addresses Axcess's core requirement: institutional lenders and borrowers need position privacy. DAML's party-based visibility ensures vault state is only shared with participants, unlike public EVM state.
- **DAML's authorization model** (signatory/observer/controller) maps naturally to Axcess's role-based access: protocol admin approves vaults, borrowers manage collateral, lenders deposit/withdraw, epoch automation processes transitions.
- **Composability with Canton ecosystem** - Axcess vaults can directly interact with other Canton-based protocols (e.g., tokenized securities, RWA platforms) for collateral or lending asset sourcing.

## 4. **Backward Compatibility**

No backward compatibility impact on existing Canton infrastructure. Axcess is a new application deployed as a DAML package on Canton participants. It introduces new templates and does not modify any existing Canton contracts or network configurations.
